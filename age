    keyboard
    ========
    
    Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.
    
    ## Features
    
    - **Global event hook** on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of focus).
    - **Listen** and **send** keyboard events.
    - Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo), with experimental **OS X** support (thanks @glitchassassin!).
    - **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
    - **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.
    - **Python 2 and 3**.
    - Complex hotkey support (e.g. `ctrl+shift+m, ctrl+space`) with controllable timeout.
    - Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#keyboard.record) and [play](#keyboard.play), [add_abbreviation](#keyboard.add_abbreviation)).
    - Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full internationalization support** (e.g. `Ctrl+ç`).
    - Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
    - Tested and documented.
    - Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).
    - Mouse support available via project [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) (`pip install mouse`).
    
    ## Usage
    
    Install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyboard/):
    
        pip install keyboard
    
    or clone the repository (no installation required, source files are sufficient):
    
        git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard
    
    or [download and extract the zip](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/archive/master.zip) into your project folder.
    
    Then check the [API docs below](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api) to see what features are available.
    
    
    ## Example
    
    
    ```py
    import keyboard
    
    keyboard.press_and_release('shift+s, space')
    
    keyboard.write('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')
    
    keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+a', print, args=('triggered', 'hotkey'))
    
    # Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type "foobar".
    keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))
    
    # Blocks until you press esc.
    keyboard.wait('esc')
    
    # Record events until 'esc' is pressed.
    recorded = keyboard.record(until='esc')
    # Then replay back at three times the speed.
    keyboard.play(recorded, speed_factor=3)
    
    # Type @@ then press space to replace with abbreviation.
    keyboard.add_abbreviation('@@', 'my.long.email@example.com')
    
    # Block forever, like `while True`.
    keyboard.wait()
    ```
    
    ## Known limitations:
    
    - Events generated under Windows don't report device id (`event.device == None`). [#21](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/21)
    - Media keys on Linux may appear nameless (scan-code only) or not at all. [#20](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/20)
    - Key suppression/blocking only available on Windows. [#22](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/22)
    - To avoid depending on X, the Linux parts reads raw device files (`/dev/input/input*`)
    but this requries root.
    - Other applications, such as some games, may register hooks that swallow all 
    key events. In this case `keyboard` will be unable to report events.
    - This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers or online gaming bots. Be responsible.

    aadddd__aabbbbrreevviiaattiioonn(source_text, replacement_text, match_suffix=False, timeout=2)
        Registers a hotkey that replaces one typed text with another. For example
        
            add_abbreviation('tm', u'™')
        
        Replaces every "tm" followed by a space with a ™ symbol (and no space). The
        replacement is done by sending backspace events.
        
        - `match_suffix` defines if endings of words should also be checked instead
        of only whole words. E.g. if true, typing 'carpet'+space will trigger the
        listener for 'pet'. Defaults to false, only whole words are checked.
        - `timeout` is the maximum number of seconds between typed characters before
        the current word is discarded. Defaults to 2 seconds.
        
        For more details see `add_word_listener`.
    
    aadddd__hhoottkkeeyy(hotkey, callback, args=(), suppress=False, timeout=1, trigger_on_release=False)
        Invokes a callback every time a hotkey is pressed. The hotkey must
        be in the format `ctrl+shift+a, s`. This would trigger when the user holds
        ctrl, shift and "a" at once, releases, and then presses "s". To represent
        literal commas, pluses, and spaces, use their names ('comma', 'plus',
        'space').
        
        - `args` is an optional list of arguments to passed to the callback during
        each invocation.
        - `suppress` defines if successful triggers should block the keys from being
        sent to other programs.
        - `timeout` is the amount of seconds allowed to pass between key presses.
        - `trigger_on_release` if true, the callback is invoked on key release instead
        of key press.
        
        The event handler function is returned. To remove a hotkey call
        `remove_hotkey(hotkey)` or `remove_hotkey(handler)`.
        before the hotkey state is reset.
        
        Note: hotkeys are activated when the last key is *pressed*, not released.
        Note: the callback is executed in a separate thread, asynchronously. For an
        example of how to use a callback synchronously, see `wait`.
        
        Examples:
        
            # Different but equivalent ways to listen for a spacebar key press.
            add_hotkey(' ', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            add_hotkey('space', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            add_hotkey('Space', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            # Here 57 represents the keyboard code for spacebar; so you will be
            # pressing 'spacebar', not '57' to activate the print function.
            add_hotkey(57, print, args=['space was pressed'])
        
            add_hotkey('ctrl+q', quit)
            add_hotkey('ctrl+alt+enter, space', some_callback)
    
    aadddd__wwoorrdd__lliisstteenneerr(word, callback, triggers=['space'], match_suffix=False, timeout=2)
        Invokes a callback every time a sequence of characters is typed (e.g. 'pet')
        and followed by a trigger key (e.g. space). Modifiers (e.g. alt, ctrl,
        shift) are ignored.
        
        - `word` the typed text to be matched. E.g. 'pet'.
        - `callback` is an argument-less function to be invoked each time the word
        is typed.
        - `triggers` is the list of keys that will cause a match to be checked. If
        the user presses some key that is not a character (len>1) and not in
        triggers, the characters so far will be discarded. By default the trigger
        is only `space`.
        - `match_suffix` defines if endings of words should also be checked instead
        of only whole words. E.g. if true, typing 'carpet'+space will trigger the
        listener for 'pet'. Defaults to false, only whole words are checked.
        - `timeout` is the maximum number of seconds between typed characters before
        the current word is discarded. Defaults to 2 seconds.
        
        Returns the event handler created. To remove a word listener use
        `remove_word_listener(word)` or `remove_word_listener(handler)`.
        
        Note: all actions are performed on key down. Key up events are ignored.
        Note: word mathes are **case sensitive**.
    
    bblloocckk__kkeeyy(key)
        Suppresses all key events of the given key, regardless of modifiers.
    
    ccaallll__llaatteerr(fn, args=(), delay=0.001)
        Calls the provided function in a new thread after waiting some time.
        Useful for giving the system some time to process an event, without blocking
        the current execution flow.
    
    cclleeaarr__aallll__hhoottkkeeyyss = unhook_all_hotkeys()
        Removes all keyboard hotkeys in use, including abbreviations, word listeners,
        `record`ers and `wait`s.
    
    cclleeaarr__hhoottkkeeyy = remove_hotkey(hotkey_or_callback)
        Removes a previously hooked hotkey. Must be called wtih the value returned
        by `add_hotkey`.
    
    ggeett__hhoottkkeeyy__nnaammee(names=None)
        Returns a string representation of hotkey from the given key names, or
        the currently pressed keys if not given.  This function:
        
        - normalizes names;
        - removes "left" and "right" prefixes;
        - replaces the "+" key name with "plus" to avoid ambiguity;
        - puts modifier keys first, in a standardized order;
        - sort remaining keys;
        - finally, joins everything with "+".
        
        Example:
        
            get_hotkey_name(['+', 'left ctrl', 'shift'])
            # "ctrl+shift+plus"
    
    ggeett__ttyyppeedd__ssttrriinnggss(events, allow_backspace=True)
        Given a sequence of events, tries to deduce what strings were typed.
        Strings are separated when a non-textual key is pressed (such as tab or
        enter). Characters are converted to uppercase according to shift and
        capslock status. If `allow_backspace` is True, backspaces remove the last
        character typed.
        
        This function is a generator, so you can pass an infinite stream of events
        and convert them to strings in real time.
        
        Note this functions is merely an heuristic. Windows for example keeps per-
        process keyboard state such as keyboard layout, and this information is not
        available for our hooks.
        
            get_type_strings(record()) #-> ['This is what', 'I recorded', '']
    
    hhooookk(callback, suppress=False, on_remove=<function <lambda> at 0x7f0ef2e35f28>)
        Installs a global listener on all available keyboards, invoking `callback`
        each time a key is pressed or released.
        
        The event passed to the callback is of type `keyboard.KeyboardEvent`,
        with the following attributes:
        
        - `name`: an Unicode representation of the character (e.g. "&") or
        description (e.g.  "space"). The name is always lower-case.
        - `scan_code`: number representing the physical key, e.g. 55.
        - `time`: timestamp of the time the event occurred, with as much precision
        as given by the OS.
        
        Returns the given callback for easier development.
    
    hhooookk__kkeeyy(key, callback, suppress=False)
        Hooks key up and key down events for a single key. Returns the event handler
        created. To remove a hooked key use `unhook_key(key)` or
        `unhook_key(handler)`.
        
        Note: this function shares state with hotkeys, so `clear_all_hotkeys`
        affects it aswell.
    
    iiss__mmooddiiffiieerr(key)
        Returns True if `key` is a scan code or name of a modifier key.
    
    iiss__pprreesssseedd(hotkey)
        Returns True if the key is pressed.
        
            is_pressed(57) #-> True
            is_pressed('space') #-> True
            is_pressed('ctrl+space') #-> True
    
    kkeeyy__ttoo__ssccaann__ccooddeess(key, error_if_missing=True)
        Returns a list of scan codes associated with this key (name or scan code).
    
    oonn__pprreessss(callback, suppress=False)
        Invokes `callback` for every KEY_DOWN event. For details see `hook`.
    
    oonn__pprreessss__kkeeyy(key, callback, suppress=False)
        Invokes `callback` for KEY_DOWN event related to the given key. For details see `hook`.
    
    oonn__rreelleeaassee(callback, suppress=False)
        Invokes `callback` for every KEY_UP event. For details see `hook`.
    
    oonn__rreelleeaassee__kkeeyy(key, callback, suppress=False)
        Invokes `callback` for KEY_UP event related to the given key. For details see `hook`.
    
    ppaarrssee__hhoottkkeeyy(hotkey)
        Parses a user-provided hotkey into nested tuples representing the
        parsed structure, with the bottom values being lists of scan codes.
        Also accepts raw scan codes, which are then wrapped in the required
        number of nestings.
        
        Example:
        
            parse_hotkey("alt+shift+a, alt+b, c")
            #    Keys:    ^~^ ^~~~^ ^  ^~^ ^  ^
            #    Steps:   ^~~~~~~~~~^  ^~~~^  ^
        
            # ((alt_codes, shift_codes, a_codes), (alt_codes, b_codes), (c_codes,))
    
    ppaarrssee__hhoottkkeeyy__ccoommbbiinnaattiioonnss(hotkey)
        Parses a user-provided hotkey. Differently from `parse_hotkey`,
        instead of each step being a list of the different scan codes for each key,
        each step is a list of all possible combinations of those scan codes.
    
    ppllaayy(events, speed_factor=1.0)
        Plays a sequence of recorded events, maintaining the relative time
        intervals. If speed_factor is <= 0 then the actions are replayed as fast
        as the OS allows. Pairs well with `record()`.
        
        Note: the current keyboard state is cleared at the beginning and restored at
        the end of the function.
    
    pprreessss(hotkey)
        Presses and holds down a hotkey (see `send`).
    
    pprreessss__aanndd__rreelleeaassee = send(hotkey, do_press=True, do_release=True)
        Sends OS events that perform the given *hotkey* hotkey.
        
        - `hotkey` can be either a scan code (e.g. 57 for space), single key
        (e.g. 'space') or multi-key, multi-step hotkey (e.g. 'alt+F4, enter').
        - `do_press` if true then press events are sent. Defaults to True.
        - `do_release` if true then release events are sent. Defaults to True.
        
            send(57)
            send('ctrl+alt+del')
            send('alt+F4, enter')
            send('shift+s')
        
        Note: keys are released in the opposite order they were pressed.
    
    rreeaadd__eevveenntt(suppress=False)
        Blocks until a keyboard event happens, then returns that event.
    
    rreeaadd__hhoottkkeeyy(suppress=True)
        Similar to `read_key()`, but blocks until the user presses and releases a
        hotkey (or single key), then returns a string representing the hotkey
        pressed.
        
        Example:
        
            read_hotkey()
            # "ctrl+shift+p"
    
    rreeaadd__kkeeyy(suppress=False)
        Blocks until a keyboard event happens, then returns that event's name or,
        if missing, its scan code.
    
    rreeccoorrdd(until='escape', suppress=False, trigger_on_release=False)
        Records all keyboard events from all keyboards until the user presses the
        given hotkey. Then returns the list of events recorded, of type
        `keyboard.KeyboardEvent`. Pairs well with
        `play(events)`.
        
        Note: this is a blocking function.
        Note: for more details on the keyboard hook and events see `hook`.
    
    rreeggiisstteerr__aabbbbrreevviiaattiioonn = add_abbreviation(source_text, replacement_text, match_suffix=False, timeout=2)
        Registers a hotkey that replaces one typed text with another. For example
        
            add_abbreviation('tm', u'™')
        
        Replaces every "tm" followed by a space with a ™ symbol (and no space). The
        replacement is done by sending backspace events.
        
        - `match_suffix` defines if endings of words should also be checked instead
        of only whole words. E.g. if true, typing 'carpet'+space will trigger the
        listener for 'pet'. Defaults to false, only whole words are checked.
        - `timeout` is the maximum number of seconds between typed characters before
        the current word is discarded. Defaults to 2 seconds.
        
        For more details see `add_word_listener`.
    
    rreeggiisstteerr__hhoottkkeeyy = add_hotkey(hotkey, callback, args=(), suppress=False, timeout=1, trigger_on_release=False)
        Invokes a callback every time a hotkey is pressed. The hotkey must
        be in the format `ctrl+shift+a, s`. This would trigger when the user holds
        ctrl, shift and "a" at once, releases, and then presses "s". To represent
        literal commas, pluses, and spaces, use their names ('comma', 'plus',
        'space').
        
        - `args` is an optional list of arguments to passed to the callback during
        each invocation.
        - `suppress` defines if successful triggers should block the keys from being
        sent to other programs.
        - `timeout` is the amount of seconds allowed to pass between key presses.
        - `trigger_on_release` if true, the callback is invoked on key release instead
        of key press.
        
        The event handler function is returned. To remove a hotkey call
        `remove_hotkey(hotkey)` or `remove_hotkey(handler)`.
        before the hotkey state is reset.
        
        Note: hotkeys are activated when the last key is *pressed*, not released.
        Note: the callback is executed in a separate thread, asynchronously. For an
        example of how to use a callback synchronously, see `wait`.
        
        Examples:
        
            # Different but equivalent ways to listen for a spacebar key press.
            add_hotkey(' ', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            add_hotkey('space', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            add_hotkey('Space', print, args=['space was pressed'])
            # Here 57 represents the keyboard code for spacebar; so you will be
            # pressing 'spacebar', not '57' to activate the print function.
            add_hotkey(57, print, args=['space was pressed'])
        
            add_hotkey('ctrl+q', quit)
            add_hotkey('ctrl+alt+enter, space', some_callback)
    
    rreeggiisstteerr__wwoorrdd__lliisstteenneerr = add_word_listener(word, callback, triggers=['space'], match_suffix=False, timeout=2)
        Invokes a callback every time a sequence of characters is typed (e.g. 'pet')
        and followed by a trigger key (e.g. space). Modifiers (e.g. alt, ctrl,
        shift) are ignored.
        
        - `word` the typed text to be matched. E.g. 'pet'.
        - `callback` is an argument-less function to be invoked each time the word
        is typed.
        - `triggers` is the list of keys that will cause a match to be checked. If
        the user presses some key that is not a character (len>1) and not in
        triggers, the characters so far will be discarded. By default the trigger
        is only `space`.
        - `match_suffix` defines if endings of words should also be checked instead
        of only whole words. E.g. if true, typing 'carpet'+space will trigger the

        - `timeout` is the maximum number of seconds between typed characters before
        the current word is discarded. Defaults to 2 seconds.
        
        Returns the event handler created. To remove a word listener use
        `remove_word_listener(word)` or `remove_word_listener(handler)`.
        
        Note: all actions are performed on key down. Key up events are ignored.
        Note: word mathes are **case sensitive**.
    
    rreelleeaassee(hotkey)
        Releases a hotkey (see `send`).
    
    rreemmaapp__hhoottkkeeyy(src, dst, suppress=True, trigger_on_release=False)
        Whenever the hotkey `src` is pressed, suppress it and send
        `dst` instead.
        
        Example:
        
            remap('alt+w', 'ctrl+up')
    
    rreemmaapp__kkeeyy(src, dst)
        Whenever the key `src` is pressed or released, regardless of modifiers,
        press or release the hotkey `dst` instead.
    
    rreemmoovvee__aabbbbrreevviiaattiioonn = remove_word_listener(word_or_handler)
        Removes a previously registered word listener. Accepts either the word used
        during registration (exact string) or the event handler returned by the
        `add_word_listener` or `add_abbreviation` functions.
    
    rreemmoovvee__aallll__hhoottkkeeyyss = unhook_all_hotkeys()
        Removes all keyboard hotkeys in use, including abbreviations, word listeners,
        `record`ers and `wait`s.
    
    rreemmoovvee__hhoottkkeeyy(hotkey_or_callback)
        Removes a previously hooked hotkey. Must be called wtih the value returned
        by `add_hotkey`.
    
    rreemmoovvee__wwoorrdd__lliisstteenneerr(word_or_handler)
        Removes a previously registered word listener. Accepts either the word used
        during registration (exact string) or the event handler returned by the
        `add_word_listener` or `add_abbreviation` functions.
    
    rreeppllaayy = play(events, speed_factor=1.0)
        Plays a sequence of recorded events, maintaining the relative time
        intervals. If speed_factor is <= 0 then the actions are replayed as fast
        as the OS allows. Pairs well with `record()`.
        
        Note: the current keyboard state is cleared at the beginning and restored at
        the end of the function.
    
    rreessttoorree__mmooddiiffiieerrss(scan_codes)
        Like `restore_state`, but only restores modifier keys.
    
    rreessttoorree__ssttaattee(scan_codes)
        Given a list of scan_codes ensures these keys, and only these keys, are
        pressed. Pairs well with `stash_state`, alternative to `restore_modifiers`.
    
    sseenndd(hotkey, do_press=True, do_release=True)
        Sends OS events that perform the given *hotkey* hotkey.
        
        - `hotkey` can be either a scan code (e.g. 57 for space), single key
        (e.g. 'space') or multi-key, multi-step hotkey (e.g. 'alt+F4, enter').
        - `do_press` if true then press events are sent. Defaults to True.
        - `do_release` if true then release events are sent. Defaults to True.
        
            send(57)
            send('ctrl+alt+del')
            send('alt+F4, enter')
            send('shift+s')
        
        Note: keys are released in the opposite order they were pressed.
    
    ssttaarrtt__rreeccoorrddiinngg(recorded_events_queue=None)
        Starts recording all keyboard events into a global variable, or the given
        queue if any. Returns the queue of events and the hooked function.
        
        Use `stop_recording()` or `unhook(hooked_function)` to stop.
    
    ssttaasshh__ssttaattee()
        Builds a list of all currently pressed scan codes, releases them and returns
        the list. Pairs well with `restore_state` and `restore_modifiers`.
    
    ssttoopp__rreeccoorrddiinngg()
        Stops the global recording of events and returns a list of the events
        captured.
    
    uunnbblloocckk__kkeeyy = unhook(remove)
        Removes a previously added hook, either by callback or by the return value
        of `hook`.
    
    uunnhhooookk(remove)
        Removes a previously added hook, either by callback or by the return value
        of `hook`.
    
    uunnhhooookk__aallll()
        Removes all keyboard hooks in use, including hotkeys, abbreviations, word
        listeners, `record`ers and `wait`s.
    
    uunnhhooookk__aallll__hhoottkkeeyyss()
        Removes all keyboard hotkeys in use, including abbreviations, word listeners,
        `record`ers and `wait`s.
    
    uunnhhooookk__kkeeyy = unhook(remove)
        Removes a previously added hook, either by callback or by the return value
        of `hook`.
    
    uunnrreeggiisstteerr__aallll__hhoottkkeeyyss = unhook_all_hotkeys()
        Removes all keyboard hotkeys in use, including abbreviations, word listeners,
        `record`ers and `wait`s.
    
    uunnrreeggiisstteerr__hhoottkkeeyy = remove_hotkey(hotkey_or_callback)
        Removes a previously hooked hotkey. Must be called wtih the value returned
        by `add_hotkey`.
    
    uunnrreemmaapp__hhoottkkeeyy = remove_hotkey(hotkey_or_callback)
        Removes a previously hooked hotkey. Must be called wtih the value returned
        by `add_hotkey`.
    
    uunnrreemmaapp__kkeeyy = unhook(remove)
        Removes a previously added hook, either by callback or by the return value
        of `hook`.
    
    wwaaiitt(hotkey=None, suppress=False, trigger_on_release=False)
        Blocks the program execution until the given hotkey is pressed or,
        if given no parameters, blocks forever.
    
    wwrriittee(text, delay=0, restore_state_after=True, exact=None)
        Sends artificial keyboard events to the OS, simulating the typing of a given
        text. Characters not available on the keyboard are typed as explicit unicode
        characters using OS-specific functionality, such as alt+codepoint.
        
        To ensure text integrity, all currently pressed keys are released before
        the text is typed, and modifiers are restored afterwards.
        
        - `delay` is the number of seconds to wait between keypresses, defaults to
        no delay.
        - `restore_state_after` can be used to restore the state of pressed keys
        after the text is typed, i.e. presses the keys that were released at the
        beginning. Defaults to True.
        - `exact` forces typing all characters as explicit unicode (e.g.
        alt+codepoint or special events). If None, uses platform-specific suggested
        value.
